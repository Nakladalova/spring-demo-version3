This project includes a web application in Java programming language to demonstrate attacks targeting it. The application is built using the Spring framework and connected to a PostgreSQL database. The most common web attacks are demonstrated and described
applications, which are Brute force attack, SQL injection attack, Cross-site scripting attack and Cross-site request forgery, access control vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, inconsistency data in the web application, and interference with the manipulation of web application parameters. Specific ways of implementing protection against these attacks are given to ensure their safe use
